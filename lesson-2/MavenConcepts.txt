We can use Maven via Maven Wrapper

Maven Lifecycle Phases
clean:- cleans temporary files and directories
default:- stuffs like building and testing
site:- generates the documentation


mvnw [clean]

pre-clean:- hook for before cleaning
clean:- does the actual cleaning (removes the target dir)
post-clean:- hook for after cleaning

mvnw [default]

compile:- compiles java code into bytecode
test:- for running unit tests
package:- creates a jar or war file
verify:- for running checks and integration tests

compile does compile ( generates the target dir)
test does both compile and test (generates reports and test-classes in target dir)
package does compile, test and package
verify does compile, test, package and verify


to run the jar file simply write
java -jar path_to_jar_file
